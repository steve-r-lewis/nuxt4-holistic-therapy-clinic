      "question": "What is the difference between Deep Tissue Treatment and Remedial/Clinical Massage?",
      "answer": "Think of a Deep Tissue Treatment as a way to address general \"all-over\" stiffness and chronic tension using slow, firm pressure on the deeper muscle layers.\n\n**Remedial / Clinical Treatment** is more like a \"detective\" session. I focus specifically on a functional problem—such as Tennis Elbow, a restricted shoulder, or a recent strain. These sessions include more assessment and targeted techniques to restore movement to a specific area."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the Remedial Treatment sometimes a shorter duration?",
      "answer": "In clinical work, the goal is a specific therapeutic change. Overworking a sensitive or injured area for a full hour can lead to \"tissue fatigue\" or excessive soreness the next day. A focused 45-minute session is often the \"sweet spot\" for the body to accept change and begin the healing process."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does \"Deep Tissue\" mean it will be painful?",
      "answer": "Not at all. Effective deep tissue work is about depth, not just pressure. I work *with* your nervous system, not against it. While you may feel some \"productive discomfort\" as a knot releases, you should never feel the need to hold your breath or tense up."
    },
    {
      "question": "I’m not sure which treatment I need. Can you help?",
      "answer": "Absolutely\\! Most clients aren't 100% sure, and that is why every session includes a consultation. I will discuss your goals—whether it’s pain relief, increased mobility, or stress reduction—and recommend the best approach for your body that day."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Seated Chair Massage \"easier\" than Table Massage?",
      "answer": "It is different, but just as effective\\! It is a fantastic option for those who find lying face-down uncomfortable, have mobility issues, or are in the later stages of pregnancy. You receive the same high level of clinical skill and care, just in a more accessible, upright position."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a consultation fee?",
      "answer": "No. A thorough consultation is essential for safe and effective treatment. The time spent discussing your health and goals is **in addition** to your hands-on massage time and is included in the treatment price.\n\n*Still unsure? I’m always happy to have a quick chat to ensure you book the treatment that’s right for you.

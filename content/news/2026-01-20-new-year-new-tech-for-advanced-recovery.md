New Year, New Tech: Advanced Recovery has arrived\!

**Happy New Year\!** 

To help you move better and recover faster in 2026, I am excited to announce the addition of two powerful clinical tools to my practice. These can be integrated into your existing treatments to accelerate your results:

* **Electric Dynamic Cupping & Light Therapy** Combining rhythmic suction with Infrared light, this treatment decompresses tight fascia and boosts circulation. It’s perfect for releasing stubborn tension in the neck, shoulders, and hips, and accelerating recovery from intense workouts.  
* **Therapeutic Ultrasound** Using sound waves to create gentle heat deep within the tissue, ultrasound stimulates cellular repair and increases oxygen flow. It is a highly effective "fast-track" for healing damaged tissue and reducing inflammation.

**Ultrasound is particularly effective for:**

* **Chronic Pain:** Back, neck, and nerve pain.  
* **Joint & Tendon Issues:** Osteoarthritis, Tendonitis, and Plantar Fasciitis.  
* **Acute Injuries:** Ligament sprains, muscle strains, and bruising.

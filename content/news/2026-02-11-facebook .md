Still looking for the perfect Valentine’s gift? Stay local\! ❤️🏝️

You don’t need to catch the ferry to Kirkwall for a premium spa experience. Give the gift of deep warmth and total relaxation right here on Westray\!

My **Blended Hot Stone Massage** is the ultimate winter treat—ideal for melting away the February chill and resetting the mind. It’s a full-body experience (excluding the face) that combines heated basalt stones with fluid massage for a deep-seated sense of calm.

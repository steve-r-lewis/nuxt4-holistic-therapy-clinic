**Hot Stone Full Body Massage 🌿**

**I am now offering a new blended approach to Hot Stone massage designed for those seeking a smooth, complete relaxation experience.**

**By combining deep heat with a manual massage, this treatment ensures the body settles into a state of relaxation without sudden changes in temperature or pressure. This warm and soothing treatment combines the therapeutic benefits of hot stones with a rich, luxurious orange massage wax, infused with the comforting aromas of spices and citrus.**

**How it works: 🔥 Warmth: Heated basalt stones are applied first to deliver deep, comforting heat into the muscles. 💆 Connection: I then move into a fluid massage concentrating on the neck, shoulders, and back. This keeps a steady connection that moves the warmth through the body and eases tension with a softer touch. ✨ Settling: Each area of the body is finished with a final round of hot stones to settle the muscles and leave a lasting feeling of deep-seated warmth.**

**This "blended" approach provides a smooth, restful flow from start to finish—ideal for anyone needing a thorough "reset" for the body and mind.**

# **Deep Tissue Treatment** 

Targeted work to release chronic muscle tension, stiffness, and fatigue caused by physical work or repetitive activity.

## **Longer description:**

Deep tissue massage is a therapeutic technique designed to reach the deeper layers of muscle and the surrounding connective tissue (fascia). Unlike a relaxing Swedish massage, deep tissue is highly functional, focusing on realigning the body and breaking down physical knots

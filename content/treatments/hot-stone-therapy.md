# **Hot Stone Massage**

## **The Ultimate Full-Body Reset.**

This comprehensive full-body treatment (excluding the face) blends the therapeutic heat of volcanic basalt stones with rhythmic manual massage. I designed it specifically for those who want to melt away deep-seated tension and "reset" a tired mind.

## **What to Expect:**

* **Warmth:** Heated basalt stones are applied first to deliver deep, comforting heat to the muscles. This softens the tissues and prepares the body for deeper relaxation.  
* **Connection:** I then transition into a fluid, rhythmic massage to target areas of specific tension. By blending the stones with manual techniques, I maintain a continuous connection that moves warmth through the body.  
* **Settling:** Each area of the body is finished with a final placement of stones to settle the muscles and leave a lasting feeling of deep-seated warmth.  

This "blended" approach ensures a smooth, restful flow from start to finish—providing a deep sense of calm that lasts long after you leave the table.

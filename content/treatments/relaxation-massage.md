# **Relaxation Massage**

Designed to calm the nervous system, reduce physical stress, and support better sleep patterns. A gentle but effective treatment to reset the body and mind.

## **Longer Description:**

A relaxation massage is a treatment designed to soothe the body and quiet the mind through a rhythmic, full-body experience. Unlike clinical or sports massages that target deep-seated injuries or specific muscle knots, this practice focuses on the superficial layers of muscle to induce a profound state of calm.

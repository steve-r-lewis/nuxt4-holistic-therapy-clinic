# @monorepo/uuidv7-generator

This layer provides a UUID-V7 generator that creates lists of mock data entries based on user-specified date ranges and the number of UUIDs required. It returns a date-ordered list with the oldest value first, making it easy to generate realistic test data or populate databases with unique identifiers. The generator utilizes the uuid-v7 package to produce RFC 4122-compliant UUIDs.
